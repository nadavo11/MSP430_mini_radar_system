# Mini Radar System Project

![Mini Radar System](/images/mini_radar.jpg)

Welcome to the Mini Radar System project repository! This project showcases the development of a compact radar system powered by a TI-msp430 microcontroller. The system integrates various hardware components, including a servo motor, Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs), and ultrasonic sensors. Additionally, it features a user-friendly PC-side software interface with a Function Selection GUI, a Graphic Radar Monitor, and a User Control Dashboard.

## Project Overview

The Mini Radar System is designed to provide real-time distance and directional information through a combination of servo motor movement, LDR-based light detection, and ultrasonic distance measurement. The system is controlled by a TI-msp430 microcontroller, which communicates with a PC over UART.

## Features

- **Servo Motor:** Enables precise directional movement, allowing the radar to scan a defined area.
- **LDRs (Light Dependent Resistors):** Detects ambient light levels, contributing to adaptive system behavior.
- **Ultrasonic Sensors:** Accurately measures distances to objects, enhancing the radar's sensing capabilities.
- **TI-msp430 Microcontroller:** Acts as the central processing unit, coordinating hardware components and communication.
- **PC-side Software Interface:** Provides users with a Function Selection GUI, a Graphic Radar Monitor, and a User Control Dashboard for seamless interaction.
